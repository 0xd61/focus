# TODO
- Load a buffer and populate auxiliary structures
- Draw cursor
- Move cursor around
- Type something

- Don't redraw if nothing has changed
- Maybe don't store font atlas in an rgba texture
- Implement semantic highlighting
    - Polymorphic structs and possibly other types
    - Highlight globals?
    - Color cursor differently depending on what scope we're in

# DONE
+ Display some text with newlines
+ Change font size according to monitor DPI
+ Detect that scale has changed and print a message
+ Make the application DPI-aware per monitor in the manifest
+ Set an application icon
+ Read a how-to about the metaprogram
