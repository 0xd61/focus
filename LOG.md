# TODO
- Copy/paste animation
- Comment/uncomment block
- Move lines up/down

- Multiple cursors
- Handle weird selection remaining when shift is held

- Don't redraw if nothing has changed
- Implement semantic highlighting
    - Polymorphic structs and possibly other types
    - Highlight globals?
    - Color cursor differently depending on what scope we're in
- Make sure cursor positioning is correct for all fonts and sizes
- Investigate stuttering when dragging the splitter
- Figure out how to anti-alias rounded corners
- Set a proper horizontal scroll limit
- Maybe don't draw too many horizontal characters
- Look into subpixel font positioning
    - Revisit the font loading code as it has some rounding to pixels there
      and consider using floats or other units for font metrics
    - Simp.draw_text only allows integer positioning
    - Should we keep using GL_NEAREST for sampling?
- Subpixel rendering: support other types of panels (lookup ft2-lcd_rendering)
  (not useful for the editor, but may be useful for games)
